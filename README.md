# Halloooo! 👋
I'm Jose. I currently work as a warehouse associate for Amazon in San Diego, CA. I'm going to begin applying for my first tech role soon, so if you want to offer me an interview, internship, job or just want to know more, feel free to contact me @ josegaguilar626@gmail.com

## Projects

175 suggestions and corrections pertaining to the textbook Introduction to Java: Programming and Data Structures (12th. Ed, Comprehensive Version).

## Tech Stack
I know core Java really well. I have a basic understanding of Spring and how to use it to build Spring MVC apps.

## Misc.

- 🇺🇸 I grew-up in El Monte, CA, and went to school at UC Santa Cruz. 🐌
- 🚙 I built-out a van in which I travelled to Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma, and Nevada. 
- ⛹️‍♂️ I used to play basketball all the time! I miss it!
- 💰 I don't survive, I THRIVE on only about $20K a year, so if you offer me a $100K+ job you can bet your butt that I am going to be in the office all day and night cooking-up some good software!
- ⚡Fun Facts!:
  - I can't swim! 🏊‍♂️ 💀
  - I'm horrible at anything artistic (dancing, singing, drawing). 🙅‍♂️
  - I've only had like 3 headaches in my whole life. 💪
